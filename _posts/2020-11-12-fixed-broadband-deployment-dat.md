Version 1 reflects data filed by the September 1, 2017 filing deadline and any revisions made before June 15, 2018. All facilities-based broadband providers are required to file data with the FCC twice a year (Form 477) on where they offer Internet access service at speeds exceeding 200 kbps in at least one direction. Fixed providers file lists of census blocks in which they can or do offer service to at least one location, with additional information about the service.
