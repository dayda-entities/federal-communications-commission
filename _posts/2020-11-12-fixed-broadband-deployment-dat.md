This data contains status reports for June 2016, with revisions accepted through May 2017.

All facilities-based broadband providers are required to file data with the FCC twice a year (Form 477) on where they offer Internet access service at speeds exceeding 200 kbps in at least one direction. Fixed providers file lists of census blocks in which they can or do offer service to at least one location, with additional information about the service. 

Version 2 of the June 30, 2016 data includes any revisions made by filers before May 16, 2017. This version therefore updates the fixed broadband deployment data released in connection with the report Internet Access Services: Status as of June 30, 2016, which was released in April, 2017.
