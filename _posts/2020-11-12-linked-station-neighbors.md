This file that is a subset of the Linked-Station Set file. This file specifies, for each U.S. or impeding Canadian station part of a linked station set, the set of stations in their linked-station set with which they need to coordinate.  Stations with which the transitioning station must coordinate are upstream neighbors (the transitioning station’s post-auction channel interferes with the upstream neighbors’ pre-auction channel); stations that must coordinate with the transitioning station are downstream neighbors (the transitioning station’s pre-auction channel interferes with the downstream neighbors’ post-auction channel). •	Contains two records for each U.S. and impeding Canadian station that is in a linked-station set, one record listing its upstream neighbors and another record listing its downstream neighbors
